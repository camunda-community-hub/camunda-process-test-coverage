> [!WARNING]
> ### Discontinued/Moved
> Due to the end of live of Camunda 7 CE with 7.24, we decided to discontinue this extension and archive the repository.
> The Release 3.0.1 will be the last one. If you are looking for functionality for Camunda 8, please refer to official
> [Camunda Process Testing](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/apis-tools/testing/getting-started/) documentation.
>
> However, we included the current state of the extension into the [holunda-io/c7](https://github.com/holunda-io/c7/) repository, where we will maintain it together with other extensions and keep it working for future C7-EE releases.
